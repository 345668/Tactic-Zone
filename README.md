# Football Analysis Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a Match analysis & Coach assistant app to help in preparing for every match based on last matches' videos for your team and for the opponent team, the app consists of 3 main parts:
- Models & modules: this part holds the computer vision, feature extraction and match analysis part.
- Recommendation systems: this part holds the formation, play style, starting 11 and bench players recommendation systems.
- LLM integration: this part holds the integration with Gemini LLM model to create a human readable opponent weakness analysis, training plan and match summary based on the data from the previous parts in addition to a chatbot to add the ability of interaction and modifying to coaches.
